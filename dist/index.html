                    <p>
                        Perhaps to begin with, it will be prudent to first 
                        know what exactly is “mental health” and its importance 
                        in our lives before we dive in to how to improve it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        According to WHO, mental health is a state
                        of well-being in which the individual realizes
                        his or her own abilities, can cope with the 
                        normal stress of life and can work productively 
                        and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution 
                        to his or her community. It is the self-actualization
                        of one’s intellectual and emotional potential.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mental health is a vital part of life as it plays 
                        an important role in our overall wellbeing. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        How is it so? Someone may ask. Well, the relationship
                        between the mind and the body is so intimate, the health
                        of one has a great impact upon the other. Your thoughts,
                        emotions, attitudes, behavior etc, has a great impact 
                        upon your overall health, and mental health means having
                        a sound mind with sound thoughts, emotions and so on, 
                        which intern becomes beneficial in promoting your overall
                        health.

                        Now, having defined what mental health is and knowing
                        what role it plays in our lives, it’s time now we learn
                        how to attain to it and to grab all its benefits upon our
                        lives.

                            While being physically healthy can improve one’s 
                            mental health, having ailments make it nearly impossible 
                            for one to attain or even maintain mental health. Laughing
                            has a tremendous benefit upon our health. It raises the 
                            levels of B lymphocytes and T cells, which are the active 
                            agents in the body’s immune system thus helping the body 
                            to fight infections. Laughing also releases a special 
                            hormone (endorphins), which act as the body’s natural pain
                            killer.
